# Project Name: Modular Approach to Equation Evaluator

## Project Info
- Date: September 2025
- Created by: Lavrenty "Larry" Orlov

## Overview
This program uses functions to perform several calculations based on user input, including: total resistance for three resistors connected in series, the total sales tax of an item, volume of a right rectangular pyramid, total parallel resistance of three resistors connected in series, the encoding of a character based on ASCII values, the distance between two coordinate points, and the solution to a general equation.

## Features
- Computes equations in various contexts based on user input
- Modular design with separate '.c' and '.h' files
- Easy to run in Visual Studio

## Tech Stack
- Language: C
- IDE: Visual Studio Community
